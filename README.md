### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am from Ukraine.

I am an experienced trader, I also install a node. Participated in various testnets, I will be glad to take part in your testnet.

Iâ€™m interested in crypto currencies and metaverse.

Projects : umee, ironfish, transformers, dws, nibiru

Roles : umee - active mainnet validator, ironfish - active testnet validator, transformers - active testnet validator, dws - testnet validator, nibiru - testnet validator

Contribution : ironfish had very different testnets, in the first phase I was actively involved in social tasks, it was something new for me, but I really liked it, I tried to participate in the ambassador program, also in all projects where I took part I tried to be useful, whether it be participating in a stress testnet, voting, or otherwise
